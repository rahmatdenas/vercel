# ADR 0006: Scaffolding and Directory Placeholder Strategy

**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

At the start of the project, we needed to establish a clear directory structure for a Next.js application before the actual implementation of features. Git does not track empty directories, which can lead to inconsistencies when multiple developers or environments are involved.

## Decision

We decided to use a **placeholder file strategy** (Commits `1071628` through `94f20d4`). We created small marker files named `a` in all primary directories:

- `app/a`
- `components/a`
- `hooks/a`
- `lib/a`
- `public/a`
- `styles/a`
- `components/ui/a`

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Structural Consistency:** The project's architectural skeleton was committed and shared before any code was written.
- **Predictable Organization:** Ensured that subsequent "Add files via upload" commits followed a pre-defined folder structure.

### Negative

- **Repository Noise:** Created 7 initial commits solely for placeholder management.
- **Cleanup Required:** These files had to be manually deleted once the actual code was implemented.

## Superseded

None
