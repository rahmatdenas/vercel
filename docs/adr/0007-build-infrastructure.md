# ADR 0007: Foundational Build Infrastructure

**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

A robust build system and type-safe environment are required to support the development of a complex network visualization application.

## Decision

In Commit `a23ec96`, we established the core build configuration:

1. **Package Management:** Standardized on `pnpm` (evidenced by the `pnpm-lock.yaml`).
2. **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`).
3. **Styles:** PostCSS configuration (`postcss.config.mjs`) for CSS processing.
4. **Tooling:** `components.json` for component management and styling preferences.

## Consequences

### Positive

* **Strict Versioning:** The inclusion of a 3000+ line lockfile ensures consistent builds across environments.
* **Type Safety:** TypeScript provides the necessary structure for complex data manipulation in the family network.

### Negative

* **Large Initial Commit:** This single commit introduced a large volume of configuration boilerplate.

## Superseded

None
